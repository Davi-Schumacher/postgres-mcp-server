# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Configuration

The repository has Claude Code permissions configured in `.claude/settings.local.json` which restricts certain bash operations for security.

## Standard Workflow

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. apply established design patterns—such as Factory, Observer, Command, and Strategy—to ensure maintainable and scalable code.
3. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
4. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
5. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
6. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
7. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
8. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.%
